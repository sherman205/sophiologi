Hey there — I'm <strong>Sophia</strong> — I'm so glad you stopped by! This is where I keep track of all my projects and fun things I'm up to these days.

I'm currently a fullstack software engineer based in Portland, OR. I recently accepted an amazing opportunity with the Bowtie team at Mindbody, where I will be working on cool Python AI chatbot using machine learning and NLP. Outside of work, I do spend a lot of time coding and learning new technologies in my spare time.

I have always had a passion for language for as long as I can remember. For that reason, it is no surprise that I chose to pursue a profession in computer language. I majored in Linguistics & Computer Science (yes that is one major) at UCLA and it was the perfect blend of human and computer language coming together.  

Unfortunately, I don't get to work on pure linguistics projects anymore, but I hope to do more computational linguistics projects for fun in my free time.

When I'm not working my brain, I'm usually outdoors, making my house beautiful, and traveling. I just love keeping busy and seeing new things.

I'm not looking for a job opportunity at the moment, but feel free to reach out if you want to talk about a potential project or even just to say hi! My inbox is always open — <strong>sherman205@gmail.com</strong>.
