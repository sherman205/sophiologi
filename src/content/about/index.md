Hi! I'm Sophia, a software engineer based in Portland, OR. I am currently working on quality infrastructure related projects with my team at Cambia Health Solutions. While that is a blast and all, I also enjoy fullstack development work. Aside from coding, I enjoy anything related to language (computer, human, etc) and spend a lot of time outdoors, making my house beautiful, and traveling. Hit me up!
